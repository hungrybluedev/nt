# Number Theory Algorithms

## Introduction

This website contains a library of algorithm implementations for common number theory operations. I wanted to implement these to make sure that I always have access to dependable fallback whenever the inputs become unwieldy.

## List of Algorithms

1. [Greatest Common Divisor](https://hungrybluedev.github.io/nt/gcd.html)
2. Diophantine Equation
3. Linear Congruence Equation
4. Chinese Remainder Theorem

## Support

_Create an issue before you create a pull-request._

Create an issue for a feature request or to report a bug. Be as detailed as possible. As a minimum, mention the page (the HTML file) in question, the expected behaviour and the observed behaviour. If it is non-trivial, mention the exact requirements needed to reproduce the environment where the bug was observed, or the new feature is required.

If you found the project useful, consider supporting me on Ko-fi or Patreon.
